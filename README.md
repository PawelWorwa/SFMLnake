# SFMLnake
Snake clone using SFML library 

**Edited:** Despite the fact this project it's a little bit rough on the edges, it's 'sentimental' as it's the first project I've worked on to the very end. \
I'm leaving it as a reference for myself to track my skill progression. \
Since you're reading this, please consider checking my latest project: [Tetris clone](https://github.com/PawelWorwa/SFMLris) ;-)

#### Introduction
This project was made purely for learning purposes. Mostly to:  
- [X] learn cmake (basics)
- [X] apply open sonar (locally or using Travis)
- [X] apply Travis (removed after configuration as it was a little bit overkill)
- [X] check out some programming patterns	
- [X] be proud of what I created :-)

Moreover… I’ve never done snake clone before so it was quite new and fun experience.  
What makes this project special?. As I’ve created some basic “clones” in the past like pong, tetris but this one as only went all the way to actual working 1.0v :-).
